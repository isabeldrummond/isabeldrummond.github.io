						<h2w>About me:</h2w> <br><br>
						<pw>
							MSc candidate in Geography, Urban, and Environmental Studies at Concordia University, 
							in the brand-new Carbon Governance Living Lab. 
							<br>
							I hold a bachelors in geography from University of Waterloo, and two post-grad diplomas from 
							the University of Toronto; one in data analytics, and one in climate change policy and practice. 
							<br><br>
							My main research focusses are in climate and environmental governance,
							with approaches in data, and intersectional applications mindful of social inequities. 
							<br>
							Having grown up on a farm in deep rural Ontario, my passion for socio-ecological
							governance has a special root in the rural / urban divide, Indigenous sovereignty, and
							community action. 
							<br> <br>
							On my spare time- I'm a major bookworm and hiker. I enjoy getting involved in local activism
							campaigns and mutual aid projects, and I can often be found with a latte and sweet pastry in hand :)
							<br><br>
							<h3w>Currently working on:</h3w> <br>
							&#127793 Pursuing my research-based masters degree at Concordia University.<br>
							&#127793 Furthering development and outreach of the <a href="https://climate-vulnerability-compass.streamlit.app/">Climate Vulnerability Compass</a>. <br>
							&#127793 Tutoring and TAing in economics, urban development, and quantitative research methods. <br>

								Master of Science: Geography, Urban, and Environmental Studes. <br>
								Two year masters research program, September 2024 - April 2026 <br>
								Our project is titled: <i>Towards a Carbon Governance Living Lab: Designing and 
								Testing Local Decarbonization Experiments. </i><br>
								Split advisory between Concordia University's Department of Geography, Urban, and Environmental Studies and the Department of 
								Business Management, I get a cross-faculty, interdisciplinary research experience to look at new and experimental governance 
								structures to work towards decarbonization. <br> 
								My research is taking a particular interest to the governance mechanisms of labs for socioecological transitions;
								multi-stakeholder partnerships, the incorporation of user feedback, and the processes to foster innovative and 
								societal change to build decarbonized cities. <br><br>
								Teaching assistant to a 3rd year undergraduate course on urban and regional economic development.

							<p>
								Over nearly three years, I worked as a bookseller in a lovely independent bookstore in
								uptown Waterloo. <br>
								When not selling the books themselves, I read voraciously, both on and off the clock.
								With books specifically, I read, sold, reviewed, recommended, marketted, and editted
								books.
								I also helped run the Instagram, organised new marketting and display strategies, and
								ran events-
								such as author signings and meet-and-greets.

							<p>
								To boost my data analytics skills acquired throughout my undergrad and research

								I got a post-grad certificate in it! <br>
								Throughout this certification process, I studied the following: <br>
								- Dashboarding <br>
								- Prediction <br>
								- Regression <br>
								- Prescriptive Analysis <br>
								- Ethical uses of artificial intelligence <br>
								This was primarily an exercise to use my pre-existing skills in data for science to
								translate into corporate environments to help me jump-start into my career.

								My undergraduate degree in geography allowed me to take a wide breadth of courses and
								find unique ways of bending
								disciplines together. My passions in environmental issues, political issues, and
								economics were fulfilled by studying
								a specialisation in "Society and Economics", to which is recognised on my diploma.<br>
								Within the Department of Geography and the larger Faculty of Environment at University
								of Waterloo, I took varying
								courses across environmental science, sustainability management, statistics, data
								management, political geography,
								and economic geography. <br>
								Through my electives, I focussed on international development, Indigenous issues,
								philosophy, and english rhetoric. <br>

							<p>
								<i>"Transnational Solidarity: A Methodological Assessment of Sentiment Analysis in
									Digital Geography"</i>
								was a methodological efficacy assessment of utilizing Python-based machine learning
								tactics to study social
								media comment sections. <br>
								Using Python, I mined 39,000 Instagram comments from bite-sized infographic themed
								Instagram pages with the theme
								around world events and actvism, and analyzed them, both by hand, and using a natural
								language processing (NLP)
								open-sourced tool. <br>
								This research was done to explore the utility and accuracy of using sentiment analysis
								for social media research,
								as well as to create a framework to analyze international solidarity commentary with
								geopolitical events- with
								a special interest into the notion of "performative activism".
